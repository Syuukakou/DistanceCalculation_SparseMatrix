# JaccardDistance_SparseMatrix

Calculate Jaccard distance for sparse matrix

Firstly, the jaccard similarity calculation code is created by [na-o-ys (github.com)](https://github.com/na-o-ys), and referenced from [Compute all pairwise vector similarities within a sparse matrix (Python) (na-o-ys.github.io)](http://na-o-ys.github.io/others/2015-11-07-sparse-vector-similarities.html)

I didn't make extensive changes to the source code, just added support for scipy.sparse.csr.csr_matrix and a little bit of other improvements.

Another way to do it is here: [python - Compute Jaccard distances on sparse matrix - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32805916/compute-jaccard-distances-on-sparse-matrix)
